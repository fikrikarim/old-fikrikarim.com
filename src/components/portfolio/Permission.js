      </h2>

      <p>Jun 2017 - Now</p>

      <p>
        Application used by students for requesting permission when they want to
        go out from dormitory. For Android and iOS.
      </p>

          App Store Link
        </a>
      </p>

      <p>Students can request permission from the app.</p>
      <img
        src={permission_1}
        height="410px"
        style={{ marginLeft: 'auto', marginRight: 'auto', display: 'block' }}
      />

      <p>
        Dormitory supervisor then will get a notification, and they can approve
        or reject the permission.
      </p>

      <img
        src={permission_2}
        height="410px"
        style={{ marginLeft: 'auto', marginRight: 'auto', display: 'block' }}
      />

      <p>
        The student will get notification again whether their permission is
        accepted. Then the student can go to the security.
      </p>

      <img
        src={permission_3}
        height="410px"
        style={{ marginLeft: 'auto', marginRight: 'auto', display: 'block' }}
      />

      <p>
        The security will ask the student name, and check on system whether the
        student has permission or not, and whether it's already time to go or
        not.
      </p>

      <img src={permission_4} />

      <p>
        Using this application we could log time when student went and when
        student arrived. The application is used daily by ~200 students, and
        maybe will be used for other schools.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use React Native for this project, because we need to target both
        Android and iOS, and we don't have a lot of developer resource, only I
        for now. For the backend we use Ruby on Rails for the API and Managed
        Database on Lightsail for the database. The project is run on AWS
        Lightsail with Dokku.
